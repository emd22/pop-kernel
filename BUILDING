For first time building:

1. run ./install.sh, follow link if cross-compiler is not installed.
2. edit variable "PROJECT_PATH" in file(CMakeLists.txt in src) to be full path to project.
3. cd into build folder
4. build cmake files: "cmake ../src"
5. build c, asm files: "make"
6. cd out of build dir, run genisoimg.sh(./genisoimg.sh)
7. open VM of choice, using iso generated.

If you are using virtualbox with extension pack, you can use
./build.sh to build, or ./full_build.sh to compile cmake files
as well.
